# Covid-19-Vaccination

This was my midterm in my Advanced R for Data Science course. The dataset used is COVID-19 Vaccine Doses Given to San Franciscans by Demographics Over Time provided by DataSF. The objective was to filter data in order to extract the number of doses within a time range, aggregate the number of doses by type of dose, aggregate number of doses by month, and create an interactive plot based on covid vaccines by race and by dose.
